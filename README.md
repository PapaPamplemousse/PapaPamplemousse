# 👋 Hi, I’m @PapaPamplemousse

## About Me

Nerd with a twisted mind, fueled by **body horror**, **dark fantasy**, and late-night compiler tantrums.

```c
for(;;)__asm__ volatile("wfi"); // eternal loop of chaos
```

🚀 Passionate about space, robotics, and things that might explode.
🐧 Advocate of **free software**, embedded chaos, and surviving undefined behavior.

> “Predictable enough to work, chaotic enough to be fun.” 🌀💥
