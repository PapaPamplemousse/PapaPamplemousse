👋 Hi, I’m @PapaPamplemousse, let me introduce myself:

- 🌱 I am a young software engineer with a specialty in embedded software 
- 👀 I’m interested in space, big robots and new technologies 
- 😍 I especially like the hawaian shirts, the Linux environment and the free software world


📜 Despite the fact that that most of my public projects are in python, my favorite programming languages are C, C++ and a litlle bit of typescript
